    "This notebook will cover a simple implementation of some work that could be conducted using linked-data. It will cover identifying important entities in text and attempting to disambiguate them against external linked-data collections. This allows us broaden the context of our data with all that is already known and publicised on the semantic web.\n",

    "We can now view the data. One thing to immediately notice is that, despite the text being about van Gogh, no entities were identified. If we inspect the names representing [van Gogh on ULAN](https://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=vincent+van+gogh&role=&nation=&prev_page=1&subjectid=500115588), we can see that there is an all lower-case representation \"van gogh\" but not the capitalised \"Van Gogh\" found in this text. This is an important not to know the database you are referencing against before relying on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other issue is that some entities are too ambiguous from just the word. We can infer from the context of the work that \"Theo\" is [Theo van Gogh](https://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=van+gogh&role=&nation=&page=1&subjectid=500339434) but given the limited context, the query has defined the entity as being \"Unidentified Named People and Firms\". For Monticelli, three different potential entities have been identified because of the ambiguity of only using a last name. Using the time-period of van Gogh's life, we can infer that [Monticelli, Adolphe](https://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANServlet?english=Y&find=Monticelli%2C+Adolphe&role=&page=1&nation=) is the more likely candidate given that they were alive at the same time as van Gogh, whereas [Monticelli, Andrea](https://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANServlet?english=Y&find=Monticelli%2C+Andrea&role=&page=1&nation=) over a century prior.

    "### Some Final Thoughts and Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This example project has some issues which arise that need to be considered when being implemented in an actual system. For each of the NER tags we chose to keep, try to think of some potential considerations that must be made when trying to disambiguate entities. Once you've had a think, expand the tab below to see some examples we have come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary>Some Example Problems & Considerations</summary>\n",
    "    <h4>People</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Names are not always enough to disambiguate people. The name \"van Gogh\" is almost always used to refer to Vincent van Gogh but there are also <a href=https://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANServlet?english=Y&find=van+gogh&role=&page=1&nation=>other painters</a> that share the same surname.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Historically, women were referred to by their husband's name e.g. Mrs. John Smith. These women may be possible to identify by context or may not be named in any historical record at all.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h4>Locations & Geopolotical Entities</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>Map borders are not static; place names in text must be disambiguated based on the time that it was written/discussing. Discussing the Roman Empire in the 1st century versus the 3rd century draws a very different world map.</li>\n",
    "        <li>Ambiguous place names such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield>Springfield</a> require context to unambiguously define. Sometimes it is impossible with the provided information.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h4>Work of Art</h4>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Identifying artworks in text using NER is very challenging as the names often appear as generic, natural language to NER systems unless specifically trained for artwork identification or at least the semantics of cultural heritage (<a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30760-8_10>source</a>)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Before the 18th century, there was little need to name artworks and so the majority of historical works have been prescribed names by galleries or art-historians based on their subject matter (<a href=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artworks-untitled>source</a>). Artwork names are not a fixed identification of a piece and may change over time, meaning the same work can have many names including \"untitled\".</li>\n",
    "    <li>By chance, intention or for the aforementioned reason, many works can share the same name, especially \"untitled\". As such, context and additional information is required to disambiguate a specific reference to an artwork.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Even trying to disambiguate by artist and title is often insufficient. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)>Sunflowers</a> is an example where van Gogh produced multiple series of the work under the same name.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these issues become the strength of linked data once accurately disambiguated. Being able to uniquely refer to a very specific entity without any possibility for misreference is very powerful for accurately assigning meta-data and progressing research. Furthermore, developing these unambiguous entities allows for others to link their knowledge with ours to expand the possibility for mapping and discovery. Once assigned a URI, you can also periodically request data from other databases and benefit from any updates or additions that they made provide. The quality of your data could improve without any effort from you if others improve their data and vice versa."
